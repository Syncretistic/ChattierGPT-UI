# ChattierGPT
A Simple and Powerful UI for the ChatGPT API.

ChattierGPT is a Python application for local use (colab version coming soon) that allows to communicate with the OpenAI ChatGPT API (gpt-3.5-turbo only for now).

ChattierGPT has a simple and complete interface, offering a compromise between what the official OpenAI chat interface allows and the advanced options of the developer API.

This tool is still in beta, bug reports and improvements are welcome!

## About the API

This tool is only intended to interact with the official OpenAI API, I do not plan to make it compatible with chat.openai.com in the near future.

To get access to the API, you need to create an account on platform.openai.com and create an API key, you can find a tutorial here: https://elephas.app/blog/how-to-create-openai-api-keys-cl5c4f21d281431po7k8fgyol0

The access to the OpenAI API is not free, the prices are available on the following page (for the moment ChattierGPT only supports gpt-3.5-turbo): https://openai.com/pricing

ChattierGPT is a tool to facilitate access to the ChatGPT API, I therefore cannot be held responsible for the use you will make of it.

Please use this tool responsibly and in accordance with the OpenAI terms of use available at: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use
