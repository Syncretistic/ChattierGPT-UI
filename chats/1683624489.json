The premise is once you have you product's traceability data, what do you do with it? How can you monetize it?  The following is my outline for the presentation.

In fact, research suggests that 20-35% of consumers care deeply about this information. Sharing this data offers several benefits, such as:\n\n1. Improved brand image\n2. Enhanced trust and loyalty\n3. Better knowledge of customers\n\nBy doing something good for society and being transparent about our food products, we can simultaneously gain a competitive advantage and increase sales.\n\nSharing Traceability Data via QR Codes\n=======================================\nTo effectively share this data, I propose using QR codes, as they are efficient, convenient, accessible, and flexible. QR codes provide numerous advantages:\n\n1. They can store virtually infinite information, reducing the need for paper labels\n2. They are cost-effective and easy to integrate into packaging\n3. They have widespread adoption, making them familiar to many consumers\n4. They are flexible, allowing content updates remotely even after printing\n\nPresenting Information in an Engaging Manner\n==============================================\nTo capture consumers' attention, we must present the traceability data in an appealing format. This means:\n\n1. Using images and visual content to communicate complex information\n2. Framing the data within a captivating story that consumers can relate to\n3. Making the information modular for easy understanding\n\nExploiting the Direct Channel to Consumers\n===========================================\nAssuming that between 1-10% of consumers will scan the QR code, we have now established a direct channel to them. With this channel, we can:\n\n1. Communicate through promotional campaigns, surveys, and funneling them to e-commerce for repeat purchases\n2. Observe consumer behavior and gather information (while adhering to GDPR), such as demographics, interests, and engagement\n\nUsing this Information for Business Growth\n===========================================\nThe information gathered allows us to:\n\n1. Create tailor-made promotional campaigns for specific buyer personas\n2. Direct our sustainability and transparency funding towards the aspects our actual customers care about\n\nIntroducing QualityChain and Conclusion\n=========================================\nQualityChain is a platform designed to streamline traceability data sharing and consumer engagement.
