Placeholder or Skeleton component:\nInstead of hiding the component, you can display a placeholder or skeleton component while loading the data.

Using `v-show` instead of `v-if`:\n`v-show` can be used if you want to toggle the visibility of the component without completely removing it from the DOM. However, it is less performant for larger components, as it only toggles the CSS `display` property.\n\n```html\n<template>\n  <AccountDetailsCard v-show=\"!loading\" :account=\"account\" />\n  <TaskCard v-for=\"task in task_list\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n3.
