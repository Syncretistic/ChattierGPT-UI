You can see some examples of the QR codes we've used over the years to tell the stories of various types of products. \n\nWe care a lot about transparency in the food supply chain. And for these reasons we're involved in a number of projects on the food transparency topic, including EU funded projects. \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd What we do is we create storytelling pages for AgriFood products that tell the consumer everything there is to know about the product its supply chain, the company efforts in sustainability and their values. Everything is made available through a QR code that is applied on the packaging and he's made invaluable using blockchain technology, which makes the information permanent and verifiable by the consumer. \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd Every page is translating in 36 languages using AI to be more inclusive and allow consumers from all over the world to access the same information.  \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd We also help companies better understand who their customers are by gathering statistics from the QR code scans, which give us agregated and fully anonymous data about the consumers who pick up the product. And scan the QR code. \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd By looking at the interactions with the pages, we're also able to see which topics are more important to the consumers in term of transparency and sustainability. All of this information is very important for future product development, as well as for deciding where to invest in terms of sustainability in the next years. \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd Currently, we're looking for both institutional and industry partners in the food and drinks industry who are passionate about sharing their stories and increasing transparency with their consumers. \n\n\u200a \ud83d\udccd We believe the products are much more than labels.
